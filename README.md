# RemoteControl
iOS app to turn on and off wifi-enabled remote relays.

This app is an advance version of https://github.com/creatica-soft/RemoteSwitch. It supports multiple relays and provides default settings view.

In addition to SwiftUI and Network frameworks, this app also uses Core Data to store the relay's parameters such as a name, an IP address and a UDP port.
